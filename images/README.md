these are the step by step snapshots taken!!!!!!!!!!!!!
schematic.png
Contains the schematic diagram of the CMOS inverter circuit. It shows the NMOS and PMOS transistors connected in a complementary fashion to implement the inverter functionality.

cmos inverter symbol.png
Displays the symbolic representation of a CMOS inverter used in circuit diagrams. Useful for high-level abstraction in digital designs.

analysis plots.png
Includes waveform plots from transient or DC analysis of the CMOS inverter, such as input-output voltage relationships and switching behavior.

vol voh vil vih vth.png
Illustrates key voltage parameters of the inverter:

VOL: Output Low Voltage

VOH: Output High Voltage

VIL: Input Low Voltage

VIH: Input High Voltage

VTH: Threshold Voltage (switching point)

Delay calculation using marker TPLH edge middle.png
Shows how propagation delay (specifically TPLH: low-to-high transition) is calculated using waveform markers. The edge and midpoint technique is used to identify the timing.

noisemargin.png
Depicts the noise margins of the CMOS inverter, indicating the acceptable noise voltage levels on input signals without affecting output integrity.

layout without label.png
The physical layout of the CMOS inverter in the IC design flow, shown without any labels or annotations.

layout.png
A more detailed version of the CMOS inverter layout, including labels and possibly layers for better understanding of the physical design.

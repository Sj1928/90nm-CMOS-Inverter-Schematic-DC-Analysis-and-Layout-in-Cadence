## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Overview

### Step 1: Design the Schematic  
Start with creating a transistor-level schematic of the CMOS inverter using PMOS and NMOS transistors.

### Step 2: Use the Inverter Symbol in Larger Circuits  
Once the schematic is verified, the inverter can be used as a symbol in larger digital circuits.

### Step 3: Run Simulations  
Simulate the inverter to analyze its performance in terms of output behavior, switching threshold, and voltage levels.

### Step 4: Analyze Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)  
Identify key parameters such as VOL, VOH, VIL, VIH, and VTH from the VTC curve.

### Step 5: Measure Propagation Delay  
Determine timing performance by measuring TPLH (low-to-high) and TPHL (high-to-low) delays.

### Step 6: Evaluate Noise Margins  
Ensure the inverter can tolerate noise in the input without affecting output logic.

### Step 7: Create Physical Layout  
Design the physical layout of the CMOS inverter using layout tools. This layout represents how the circuit would be fabricated.

### Step 8: Annotate the Layout  
Label the different parts of the layout for easier verification and design rule checks.
